            <p>I walked across an empty land</p>
            <P>I knew the pathway like the back of my hand</P>
            <p>I felt the earth beneath my feet</P>
                <p>Sat by the river and it made me complete</P>

            
        
        
            <p>Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?</P>
                <P>  I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on</P>
                <P>  So, tell me when you're gonna let me in</P>
                <P> I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin</P>
        
           
        
            <p>I came across a fallen tree </p>
            <p>  I felt the branches of it looking at me </p>
            <p> Is this the place we used to love? </p>
            <p> Is this the place that I've been dreaming of? </p>
        

        
            <p>And if you have a minute, why don't we go </p>
            <p> Talk about it somewhere only we know? </p>
            <p> This could be the end of everything </p>
            <p> So, why don't we go somewhere only we know? </p>
            <p>Somewhere only we know </p>
            <p> Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?</p>

          <p>Ooh, oh-oh</p>
           <p>Ah, oh</p>
          <p>This could be the end of everything</p>
